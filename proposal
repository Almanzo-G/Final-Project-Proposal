The big idea behind your project (i.e. what are you making / doing)?
We're making a text-based horror game, which requires players to find the right methods to escape from a room. 
There are many questions that are able to provide hints to find the key.
What are the (major) building blocks the project will need to be successful?
Human's behaviors and actions.
Questions with answers.
Which do you know how to build already, and which ones do you still need to figure out?
Human's activities can be inherited from Contract.
Question arraylists.
Are there any potential roadblocks?
Since every player has different talking habits, it's hard to relate their input with our default input.
How does your team plan to divide up the work needed to complete this project?
We would like to work together, maybe both "navigator" and driver.
